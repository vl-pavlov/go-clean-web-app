# `internal/pkg/repository`

Within the directory, you might place packages that are responsible for interacting with a database or any other data storage mechanism. These packages typically contain functions and methods for querying and manipulating data, thus serving as an abstraction layer between your application and the data source.

By structuring your code in this way, you separate your data access logic into dedicated repository packages, which can make your code more modular, testable, and maintainable. It also helps in keeping the concerns of data access separate from other parts of your application.
