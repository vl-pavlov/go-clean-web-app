# In-memory repository

In-memory repository is a type of repository implementation that stores domain objects entirely in memory, rather than persisting them to a database or some other external storage system. In-memory repositories are commonly used for testing and prototyping purposes, as well as in scenarios where the actual persistence of data is not a primary concern.
